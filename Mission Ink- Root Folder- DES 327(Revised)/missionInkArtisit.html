                    <p>
                        My name is Bruno G. Corvalan, I was born in Mendoza, Argentina in the year of 1988. Since a very young age I have always been attracted to art. Drawing, painting, digital art, and many other types of medium have always kept me interested and inspired. I was introduces to tattooing and immediately fell in love with it. It is the ultimate canvas where no mistakes are allowed. I am always looking forward to learn new things, and challenge myself to improve every day. I hope that one day, I too can inspire other young artists. You'll find Bruno at Mission Ink Tuesday-Saturday

                    <p>
                        Hi I’m Indy, Raised on a horse farm in southern Michigan, attended Kendall college of art and design, for a bachelors in illustration and sculpture, after promptly started my apprenticeship in 2010. Since then I have been living on various islands in Hawaii, the islands do seem small after a while and I was ready for foggier pastures..so I came to beautiful San Francisco. Everyone I see here had such incredible work. I’m excited to make new and interesting tattoos. I love doing, traditional bold colored tattoos and line based work, whether fine line, cross-hatching or mandalas. Tattooing animals are my favorite!
